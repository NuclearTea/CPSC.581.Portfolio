      <h1>Michael's Gallery</h1>
    </a>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Imagine you had 30 seconds to learn about Michael. Gain the opportunity
      to take snapshots of his hand-drawn images which contain nuggets of his
      life and interests. Inspect the snapshots you take and try as many times
      as you want. You won't be able to catch everything the first time!
    </p>

    <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      The following are my initial 10 sketches. They are a variety of different
      types of websites that attempt to highlight different aspects of
      Michael. In a sense, they are also a reflection, of my own journey on
      learning about Michael, his interests, his likes/dislikes and his
      overall lifestyle. In my initial meeting, I attempted to jot down the
      things that were important to Michael by asking about where he spends
      most of his time. In addition, I asked about fond memories he had and
      things he liked to do as a child. They vary from games to simple
      "discover something about Michael".

                The idea with this is that it was a discovery game where we
                would go on the journey to discover Michael's interests,
                similar to how I went a journey to discover his interests.

              <h3>Initial Sketch 2</h3>
              <p>
                This introduces the use of a crosshair because I learned that
                Micheal likes photography. This is an important feature as
                this is something that we used in our final design. The user
                would be able to use the crosshair to move around and select
                different areas like music or books and learn about his
                favourites. This is also important as this idea is present in
                1 of Michael's final drawings.

                The top sketch highlights his room (which is dirty because
                Michael said he often procrastinates) and upon cleaning it, we
                learn about his favourite albums. This is idea is reflected in
                2 of his handrawn images, one featuring his room, and the
                other featuring his favourite albums.

              <p>
                This is referencing a canvas because Michael likes to draw.
                This became important as Michael actually drew the backgrounds
                of the final assignment, highlighting the different aspects of
                Michael.

              This was an idea where the user could select a piece of the
              background which showed nature (because Michael likes walking in
              nature). Clicking in specific areas would allow you to
              experience different things like rock climbing or walking in
              nature.

                The top sketch is a drawing tool which would highlight
                Michael's interest of drawing.
              </p>
              <p>
                The bottom sketch is a game which allowed the user to select
                multiple options which would increase or decrease his happy
                level vs energy level. This became one of the ideas which we
                decided to refine.

    <h3>Refined Sketches</h3>
    <p>
      The following are refined sketches where we looked at all of our initial
      sketches (30) and then picked 2 ideas to focus and refine. The ideas
      chosen where a combination of ideas that we all had which where a
      picture taking app and an app which had choices in Michael's day and
      either increase/decrease his work/happiness.

              <h3>Refined Sketch 1</h3>

                The Idea was simply, take a picture, and store it in a gallery
                that where they could be inspected, nothing else. This became the
                cornerstone of the project.

              <h3>Refined Sketch 3</h3>

                This added the idea of 3 bars, rather than 2 which would
                change based on the actions taken. This was tabled because
                having 3 bars seems like too much.

                Another combination, the user would take pictures which would
                take you to special games that were things that Michael liked
                to do like rock climbing or walking in nature and store them
                in video experience galleries. This seemed a bit much storing

                This was an idea which combined the game aspect and the
                energy/happy bar aspect where the user would select things to
                do which would affect his energy and happy levels but if he
                went too much happy, he would get stuck and procrastinate,
                causing the screen to loop on it self (like a retro game
                ending) causing Michael to be unable to finish his work.

              This was an idea which would allow the user to select some of
              Michael's favourite albums, and depending on how they made
              Michael feel, they would go to a snapshot taking mode where you
              could create a gallery of the background while the album played
              in the background.

              <p>
                This was the similar idea of a gallery but with a timer, I got
                this as inspiration from another team mate (Erich I believe).

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      I was very pleased with the outcome of this assignment. I learnt a lot
      about the design process and I personally found the amount of sketching
      really valuable though quite difficult. I thought our idea reflected the
      personality of Michael in both obvious and subtle ways which was
      something that I was aiming for from the beginning. It really helps that
      Michael can draw!
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally came up with some ideas regarding the photography and the
      gallery. I'm not necessarily sure who actually came up with the idea as
      we kind of talked and shared our ideas before all 10 sketches were
      finished and we influenced each other but I really like that we did that
      as it allowed me to gain different ideas and learn even more things
      about Michael. I also helped with development of the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our process in deciding what we chose was just going through the ideas,
      picking apart what was similar and different as well as taking into
      consideration the difficulty of implementation. Overall, I am happy with
      the direction we went!

      <h1>Bop It</h1>
    </a>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      When tasked to create a novel way of unlocking our phones, what better place to take inspiration from than
      childhood nostalgia.
      Presenting the Bop It unlock method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using some shakes, twists, pulls and bops, you can unlock your phone in a secure manner, with the authentic sound
      of the original.

    <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

    <p>The following are some initial sketches that show some of the inspiration for this idea. It was an idea that my
      partner Alan and I came up together and many of our sketches were quite similar as well.</p>

              <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
              <p>
                This is the most basic idea which pretty much everyone had which was: "track the movements of the phone
                and make that your password.".
                This idea is the base of 'Bop-It unlock method', which really constrains the movements into 4 distinct
                categories.

              <p>
                This second image is quite important as it was chosen to be one of the refined sketches.
                It describes using the peripherals of our reach and body proportions to unlock our phones.
                I thought this was a good idea because it uses our unique combination of body proportions to unlock our
                phones, making it quite safe and easy.

                Sketch 3 plays with the idea of having a specific, limited amount of movements that are well defined to
                unlock our phones.
                It simple describes a juggle routine which would be mapped by the user on the setup of the lock.

    <h3>Refined Sketches</h3>

    <p>After all of our initial sketches, we decided to refine 3 of them. Those 3 were:
    <ul>
      <li>Tilt your phone game to unlock your phone (original idea from Hima)</li>
      <li>Using AR (Augmented Reality) and a map to find something notable and unique to unlock your phone (original
        idea from Alan)</li>
      <li>Using Body Proportions to unlock your phone (my idea)</li>
    </ul>
    </p>

                Using the gyroscope and accelerometer, you can tilt your phone to drain the amount of water in 6
                different drains. If you get the proportions correct, you can unlock your phone.

              <p>
                Using Alan's idea for AR, I thought giving a situation of a front-door and somewhere in the augmented
                space, a key is hidden (in this case, underneath a rug) to unlock your phone.

                This is a combination (no pun intended) of my idea and Alan's idea for AR where you use AR to show a
                lock, and like a real lock, you have to input a correct number sequence while at the same time, the
                phone is analyzing your hands proportions to ensure that it is you.
