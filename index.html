      <h1>Michael's Gallery</h1>
    </a>

    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>
      Imagine you had 30 seconds to learn about Michael. Gain the opportunity
      to take snapshots of his hand-drawn images which contain nuggets of his
      life and interests. Inspect the snapshots you take and try as many times
      as you want. You won't be able to catch everything the first time!
    </p>

    <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

    <p>
      The following are my initial 10 sketches. They are a variety of different
      types of websites that attempt to highlight different aspects of
      Michael. In a sense, they are also a reflection, of my own journey on
      learning about Michael, his interests, his likes/dislikes and his
      overall lifestyle. In my initial meeting, I attempted to jot down the
      things that were important to Michael by asking about where he spends
      most of his time. In addition, I asked about fond memories he had and
      things he liked to do as a child. They vary from games to simple
      "discover something about Michael".

              The idea with this is that it was a discovery game where we
              would go on the journey to discover Michael's interests,
              similar to how I went a journey to discover his interests.

          <h3>Initial Sketch 2</h3>
          <p>
            This introduces the use of a crosshair because I learned that
            Micheal likes photography. This is an important feature as
            this is something that we used in our final design. The user
            would be able to use the crosshair to move around and select
            different areas like music or books and learn about his
            favourites. This is also important as this idea is present in
            1 of Michael's final drawings.

    <h3>Refined Sketches</h3>
    <p>
      The following are refined sketches where we looked at all of our initial
      sketches (30) and then picked 2 ideas to focus and refine. The ideas
      chosen where a combination of ideas that we all had which where a
      picture taking app and an app which had choices in Michael's day and
      either increase/decrease his work/happiness.

                The Idea was simply, take a picture, and store it in a gallery
                that where they could be inspected, nothing else. This became the
                cornerstone of the project.

                This added the idea of 3 bars, rather than 2 which would
                change based on the actions taken. This was tabled because
                having 3 bars seems like too much.

                Another combination, the user would take pictures which would
                take you to special games that were things that Michael liked
                to do like rock climbing or walking in nature and store them
                in video experience galleries. This seemed a bit much storing
                the videos.

                This was an idea which combined the game aspect and the
                energy/happy bar aspect where the user would select things to
                do which would affect his energy and happy levels but if he
                went too much happy, he would get stuck and procrastinate,
                causing the screen to loop on it self (like a retro game
                ending) causing Michael to be unable to finish his work.

              This was an idea which would allow the user to select some of
              Michael's favourite albums, and depending on how they made
              Michael feel, they would go to a snapshot taking mode where you
              could create a gallery of the background while the album played
              in the background.

                This played of the idea of a gallery but rather than be
                albums, or nature, it was a table with his favourite food.
                This became one of the drawings that Michael eventually made.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      I was very pleased with the outcome of this assignment. I learnt a lot
      about the design process and I personally found the amount of sketching
      really valuable though quite difficult. I thought our idea reflected the
      personality of Michael in both obvious and subtle ways which was
      something that I was aiming for from the beginning. It really helps that
      Michael can draw!
    </p>
    <p>
      I personally came up with some ideas regarding the photography and the
      gallery. I'm not necessarily sure who actually came up with the idea as
      we kind of talked and shared our ideas before all 10 sketches were
      finished and we influenced each other but I really like that we did that
      as it allowed me to gain different ideas and learn even more things
      about Michael. I also helped with development of the app.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our process in deciding what we chose was just going through the ideas,
      picking apart what was similar and different as well as taking into
      consideration the difficulty of implementation. Overall, I am happy with
      the direction we went!

      <h1>Bop It</h1>
    </a>

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      When tasked to create a novel way of unlocking our phones, what better place to take inspiration from than
      childhood nostalgia.
      Presenting the Bop It unlock method.
    </p>
    <p>
      Using some shakes, twists, pulls and bops, you can unlock your phone in a secure manner, with the authentic sound
      of the original.
    </p>

    <img class="A2-Description-Image" src="assets/A2 Description Image.png">

    <p>In terms of its security, I would say that having a password that is at least like 6 motions long would be ideal
      as otherwise, it would be really easy to break in. Additionally, we do have sounds though, for highest security it
      would be better to turn the sound off so that others would not be able to hear it.
    </p>

    <p>Accidental unlocks would pretty much be impossible with this approach as it requires a non-random complete set of
      movements to approve the password and fails otherwise.</p>

    <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

    <p>The following are some initial sketches that show some of the inspiration for this idea. It was an idea that my
      partner Alan and I came up together and many of our sketches were quite similar as well.</p>

              <h3>Sketch 1</h3>
              <p>
                This is the most basic idea which pretty much everyone had which was: "track the movements of the phone
                and make that your password.".
                This idea is the base of 'Bop-It unlock method', which really constrains the movements into 4 distinct
                categories.

                This second image is quite important as it was chosen to be one of the refined sketches.
                It describes using the peripherals of our reach and body proportions to unlock our phones.
                I thought this was a good idea because it uses our unique combination of body proportions to unlock our
                phones, making it quite safe and easy.

                Dragging in a specific pattern would become the password. Obviously, didn't go with this idea as it

      <li>Tilt your phone game to unlock your phone (original idea from Hima)</li>
      <li><img src="assets/A2 Initial Sketches/Hima Initial Sketch.jpg" alt="Hima Initial Sketch"></li>
      <li>Using AR (Augmented Reality) and a map to find something notable and unique to unlock your phone (original
        idea from Alan)</li>

      <li>Using Body Proportions to unlock your phone (my idea)</li>

                Using Alan's idea for AR, I thought giving a situation of a front-door and somewhere in the augmented

                This is a combination (no pun intended) of my idea and Alan's idea for AR where you use AR to show a
                lock, and like a real lock, you have to input a correct number sequence while at the same time, the
                phone is analyzing your hands proportions to ensure that it is you.

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>
      I wanted to add some more things because I think our project is a bit simple conceptually but I like the fact that
      we all used on childhood nostalgia to create this. Even though it may be a bit simplistic, it comes from a place
      thats rooted in our experiences and think that gives the idea more substance. Additionally, I would have liked to
      add more things to make it more thematic, but combining a lock screen with a Bop-It is not the easiest thing to
      do.
    </p>
    <p>In terms of the development of the idea, it was something that Alan and I came up with while sharing our
      sketches. I think we all had some cool ideas in our refined sketches, but they also seemed difficult to implement
      well. Considering the amount of time it took us to calibrate this, I'm glad we went with the simple option.</p>

    <h1>Proxemics Personal Project</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>We were tasked to use the idea of proxemics to make anything we wanted. Some of the prompts given were:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A mobile interface for a smart object</li>
      <li>A stationary display that solves a problem in your home</li>
      <li>An application that helps support a multi-person in-person situation</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Initial Sketches</h2>
    <p>Below are my initial sketches. They range from musical instruments, smart appliances/tools and even methods to
      enhance plays/performances along with some other ideas</p>

    <h2>Initial Sketch Description</h2>
    <p>I explored some ideas that were more utility based and some others that are using proxemics to enhance our
      experience</p>
    <p>I personally felt that they ideas which were the most creative were the ones that enhanced the embodied
      experience of something already</p>
    <p>These can be seen in <strong>Page 2</strong> & <strong>Page 4</strong></p>
    <div class="detailed-page-descriptions row">
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Page 2</h3>
        <p>
          This depicts 3 sketches which show different ways that proxemics could be used to produce music. THe first
          sketch
          is like twister, but the areas are covered with detectable symbols.
        </p>
        <p>The second sketch shows someone using something that has detectable symbols which are mapped to musical
          instruments. The position and distance from the camera cause the sound to change.</p>
        <p>The third sketch shows a similar idea to the above except that garbage bags are lined with these symbols
          which can then be wrapped around other objects, making anything a musical instrument.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>Page 4</h3>
        <p>This shows 2 sketches which outline different ways a play/performance could be enhanced with the use of
          proxemics</p>
        <p>The first sketch outlines how characters (which would be recognized somehow) could act out a performance and
          a narration could occur in tandem with their performance along with music. It could use AI or something to
          adapt to the script. It would use the position of the characters, their distance between each other, the
          distance from the camera, and other parameters to contribute to the performance.</p>
        <p>The second sketch displays a similar idea except that the performance is done using puppets instead of
          actors. The difference being that one person could play multiple characters as well as the fact that it is
          harder to tell a story with puppets than it is from a live show. </p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>I decided to refine and storyboard my play/puppet and musical instrument ideas as I felt that proxemics could be
      a novel way of expressing these artistic modes</h3>

    <h3>Below you can see my storyboard for the Universal Proxemic Musical Instrument</h3>
    <img height="25%" width="25%" src="assets/A3 Proxemics Storyboard/Proxemics Storyboard.jpg">
    <div class="column">
      <p>This describes the two ways I could think of using this Universal Proxemic Musical Instrument</p>
      <p>Either, you can move the objects to let the sensors detect them or move the sensor to detect which object.</p>
      <p>Additionally, you are not impaired from making anything an instrument by added the symbol that lets it detect
      </p>

    </iframe>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I personally think that I may have gone a bit overboard with the implementation as it took way too much time than
      it needed.</p>
    <p>Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the way it came out, though I wanted to add some more features, but thats for
      another day.</p>
    <p>I think I liked this assignment the most as this was the one where I had the most creative ideas I think and so
      it was pretty hard for me to pick what idea to continue with.
      Specifically, I really like my play/puppet show idea and thought it had potential however I thought that it might
      have been too much.
    </p>
    <p>Also, I wish I had some teammates because I think some of my ideas need to be tempered and processed by others so
      that they can help me filter the good and bad ideas.</p>
    <p>I had a lot of fun making this project and I think I showed to myself the variety of ideas that I can produce, I
      just need to learn on filtering them appropriately.</p>
