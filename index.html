        <h1>Michael's Gallery</h1>
      </a>

      <h3>Description</h3>

      <p>
        Imagine you had 30 seconds to learn about Michael. Gain the opportunity
        to take snapshots of his hand-drawn images which contain nuggets of his
        life and interests. Inspect the snapshots you take and try as many times
        as you want. You won't be able to catch everything the first time!
      </p>

      <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>

      <p>
        The following are some of my initial sketches (10 in total). They are a
        variety of different types of websites that attempt to highlight
        different aspects of Michael. In a sense, they are also a reflection, of
        my own journey on learning about Michael, his interests, his
        likes/dislikes and his overall lifestyle. In my initial meeting, I
        attempted to jot down the things that were important to Michael by
        asking about where he spends most of his time. In addition, I asked
        about fond memories he had and things he liked to do as a child. They
        vary from games to simple "discover something about Michael".

              The idea with this is that it was a discovery game where we would
              go on the journey to discover Michael's interests, similar to how
              I went a journey to discover his interests.

            <p>
              This introduces the use of a crosshair because I learned that
              Micheal likes photography. This is an important feature as this is
              something that we used in our final design. The user would be able
              to use the crosshair to move around and select different areas
              like music or books and learn about his favourites. This is also
              important as this idea is present in 1 of Michael's final
              drawings.

              The top sketch highlights his room (which is dirty because Michael
              said he often procrastinates) and upon cleaning it, we learn about
              his favourite albums. This is idea is reflected in 2 of his
              hand-drawn images, one featuring his room, and the other featuring
              his favourite albums.

              refine.

      <h3>Refined Sketches</h3>
      <p>
        The following are refined sketches where we looked at all of our initial
        chosen where a combination of ideas that we all had which where a
        sketches (30) and then picked 2 ideas to focus and refine. The ideas
        picture taking app are related to the picture taking application.

          />
          <h3>Refined Sketch 5</h3>
          <p>
            The user would take pictures which would take you to special games
            that were things that Michael liked to do like rock climbing or
            walking in nature and store them in video experience galleries. This
            seemed a bit much storing the videos.

            alt="A3 Proxemics Initial Sketch 7"
          />

          <h3>Refined Sketch 7</h3>
          <p>
            This was an idea which would allow the user to select some of
            Michael's favourite albums, and depending on how they made Michael
            feel, they would go to a snapshot taking mode where you could create
            a gallery of the background while the album played in the
            background.
          </p>

          />
          <h3>Refined Sketch 8</h3>
          <p>
            This played of the idea of a gallery but rather than be albums, or
            nature, it was a table with his favourite food. This became one of
            the drawings that Michael eventually made.
          </p>

          />

          <h3>Refined Sketch 9</h3>
          <p>
            This was an idea which allowed the user to take snapshots of his
            room which had different posters of what he liked like retro games
            (Mario, Final Fantasy, etc.)
          </p>

          />

          <h3>Refined Sketch 10</h3>
          <p>
            This was the similar idea of a gallery but with a timer, I got this
            as inspiration from another team mate (Erich I believe).

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I was very pleased with the outcome of this assignment. I learnt a lot
        about the design process and I personally found the amount of sketching
        really valuable though quite difficult. I thought our idea reflected the
        personality of Michael in both obvious and subtle ways which was
        something that I was aiming for from the beginning. It really helps that
        Michael can draw!
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally came up with some ideas regarding the photography and the
        gallery. I'm not necessarily sure who actually came up with the idea as
        we kind of talked and shared our ideas before all 10 sketches were
        finished and we influenced each other but I really like that we did that
        as it allowed me to gain different ideas and learn even more things
        about Michael. I also helped with development of the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our process in deciding what we chose was just going through the ideas,
        picking apart what was similar and different as well as taking into
        consideration the difficulty of implementation. Overall, I am happy with
        the direction we went!

            When tasked to create a novel way of unlocking our phones, what
            better place to take inspiration from than childhood nostalgia.
            Presenting the Bop It unlock method. Using some shakes, twists,
            pulls and bops, you can unlock your phone in a secure manner, with
            the authentic sound of the original.

          <p>
            In terms of its security, I would say that having a password that is
            at least like 6 motions long would be ideal as otherwise, it would
            be really easy to break in. Additionally, we do have sounds though,
            for highest security it would be better to turn the sound off so
            that others would not be able to hear it.

        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <p>
            Accidental unlocks would pretty much be impossible with this
            approach as it requires a non-random complete set of movements to
            approve the password and fails otherwise.

              This is the most basic idea which pretty much everyone had which
              was: "track the movements of the phone and make that your
              password.". This idea is the base of 'Bop-It unlock method', which
              really constrains the movements into 4 distinct categories.

              This was to create an adapter which could enter the charging port

              need to use the adapter and insert the correct key to unlock their

              This image is quite important as it was chosen to be one of the
              refined sketches. It describes using the peripherals of our reach
              and body proportions to unlock our phones. I thought this was a
              good idea because it uses our unique combination of body
              proportions to unlock our phones, making it quite safe and easy.

      <h3>Reflection</h3>
      <p>
        I wanted to add some more things because I think our project is a bit
        simple conceptually but I like the fact that we all used on childhood
        nostalgia to create this. Even though it may be a bit simplistic, it
        comes from a place thats rooted in our experiences and think that gives
        the idea more substance. Additionally, I would have liked to add more
        things to make it more thematic, but combining a lock screen with a
        Bop-It is not the easiest thing to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of the development of the idea, it was something that Alan and
        I came up with while sharing our sketches. I think we all had some cool
        ideas in our refined sketches, but they also seemed difficult to
        implement well. Considering the amount of time it took us to calibrate
        this, I'm glad we went with the simple option.

      <h2>Initial Sketch Description</h2>
      <p>
        I explored some ideas that were more utility based and some others that
        are using proxemics to enhance our experience
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally felt that they ideas which were the most creative were the
        ones that enhanced the embodied experience of something already
      </p>
      <p>
        These can be seen in <strong>Page 2</strong> & <strong>Page 4</strong>

        <div class="column">
          <h3>Page 2</h3>
          <p>
            This depicts 3 sketches which show different ways that proxemics
            could be used to produce music. THe first sketch is like twister,
            but the areas are covered with detectable symbols.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second sketch shows someone using something that has detectable
            symbols which are mapped to musical instruments. The position and
            distance from the camera cause the sound to change.
          </p>
          <p>
            The third sketch shows a similar idea to the above except that
            garbage bags are lined with these symbols which can then be wrapped
            around other objects, making anything a musical instrument.
          </p>

          <h3>Page 4</h3>
          <p>
            This shows 2 sketches which outline different ways a
            play/performance could be enhanced with the use of proxemics
          </p>
          <p>
            The first sketch outlines how characters (which would be recognized
            somehow) could act out a performance and a narration could occur in
            tandem with their performance along with music. It could use AI or
            something to adapt to the script. It would use the position of the
            characters, their distance between each other, the distance from the
            camera, and other parameters to contribute to the performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second sketch displays a similar idea except that the
            performance is done using puppets instead of actors. The difference
            being that one person could play multiple characters as well as the
            fact that it is harder to tell a story with puppets than it is from
            a live show.

        I decided to refine and storyboard my play/puppet and musical instrument
        ideas as I felt that proxemics could be a novel way of expressing these

          This describes the two ways I could think of using this Universal
          Proxemic Musical Instrument
        </p>
        <p>
          Either, you can move the objects to let the sensors detect them or
          move the sensor to detect which object.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, you are not impaired from making anything an instrument
          by added the symbol that lets it detect

      <h2>Reflection</h2>
      <p>
        I personally think that I may have gone a bit overboard with the
        implementation as it took way too much time than it needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the way it came out, though I wanted
        to add some more features, but thats for another day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I liked this assignment the most as this was the one where I had
        the most creative ideas I think and so it was pretty hard for me to pick
        what idea to continue with. Specifically, I really like my play/puppet
        show idea and thought it had potential however I thought that it might
        have been too much.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I wish I had some teammates because I think some of my ideas need
        to be tempered and processed by others so that they can help me filter
        the good and bad ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a lot of fun making this project and I think I showed to myself
        the variety of ideas that I can produce, I just need to learn on
        filtering them appropriately.
