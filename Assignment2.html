              When tasked to create a novel way of unlocking our phones, what
              better place to take inspiration from than childhood nostalgia.
              Presenting the Bop It unlock method. Using some shakes, twists,
              pulls and bops, you can unlock your phone in a secure manner, with
              the authentic sound of the original.

              In terms of its security, I would say that having a password that
              is at least like 6 motions long would be ideal as otherwise, it
              would be really easy to break in. Additionally, we do have sounds
              though, for highest security it would be better to turn the sound
              off so that others would not be able to hear it.

              Accidental unlocks would pretty much be impossible with this
              approach as it requires a non-random complete set of movements to
              approve the password and fails otherwise.

                This is the most basic idea which pretty much everyone had which
                was: "track the movements of the phone and make that your
                password.". This idea is the base of 'Bop-It unlock method',
                which really constrains the movements into 4 distinct
                categories.

                This was to create an adapter which could enter the charging
                port and the adapter had a key slot for a physical key. The user
                would need to use the adapter and insert the correct key to
                unlock their phone.

                This image is quite important as it was chosen to be one of the
                refined sketches. It describes using the peripherals of our
                reach and body proportions to unlock our phones. I thought this
                was a good idea because it uses our unique combination of body
                proportions to unlock our phones, making it quite safe and easy.

                This plays with the idea of having a specific, limited amount of
                movements that are well defined to unlock our phones. It simple
                describes a juggle routine which would be mapped by the user on
                the setup of the lock.

          I wanted to add some more things because I think our project is a bit
          simple conceptually but I like the fact that we all used on childhood
          nostalgia to create this. Even though it may be a bit simplistic, it
          comes from a place thats rooted in our experiences and think that
          gives the idea more substance. Additionally, I would have liked to add
          more things to make it more thematic, but combining a lock screen with
          a Bop-It is not the easiest thing to do.
        </p>
        <p>
          In terms of the development of the idea, it was something that Alan
          and I came up with while sharing our sketches. I think we all had some
          cool ideas in our refined sketches, but they also seemed difficult to
          implement well. Considering the amount of time it took us to calibrate
          this, I'm glad we went with the simple option.
