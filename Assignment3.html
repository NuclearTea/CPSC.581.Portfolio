        <h2>Initial Sketch Description</h2>
        <p>
          I explored some ideas that were more utility based and some others
          that are using proxemics to enhance our experience
        </p>
        <p>
          I personally felt that they ideas which were the most creative were
          the ones that enhanced the embodied experience of something already
        </p>
        <p>
          These can be seen in <strong>Page 2</strong> & <strong>Page 4</strong>
        </p>

          <div class="column">
            <h3>Page 2</h3>
            <p>
              This depicts 3 sketches which show different ways that proxemics
              could be used to produce music. THe first sketch is like twister,
              but the areas are covered with detectable symbols.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second sketch shows someone using something that has
              detectable symbols which are mapped to musical instruments. The
              position and distance from the camera cause the sound to change.
            </p>
            <p>
              The third sketch shows a similar idea to the above except that
              garbage bags are lined with these symbols which can then be
              wrapped around other objects, making anything a musical
              instrument.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="column">
            <h3>Page 4</h3>
            <p>
              This shows 2 sketches which outline different ways a
              play/performance could be enhanced with the use of proxemics
            </p>
            <p>
              The first sketch outlines how characters (which would be
              recognized somehow) could act out a performance and a narration
              could occur in tandem with their performance along with music. It
              could use AI or something to adapt to the script. It would use the
              position of the characters, their distance between each other, the
              distance from the camera, and other parameters to contribute to
              the performance.
            </p>
            <p>
              The second sketch displays a similar idea except that the
              performance is done using puppets instead of actors. The
              difference being that one person could play multiple characters as
              well as the fact that it is harder to tell a story with puppets
              than it is from a live show.

        <h3>
          I decided to refine and storyboard my play/puppet and musical
          instrument ideas as I felt that proxemics could be a novel way of
          expressing these artistic modes
        </h3>

        <h3>
          Below you can see my storyboard for the Universal Proxemic Musical
          Instrument

            This describes the two ways I could think of using this Universal
            Proxemic Musical Instrument
          </p>
          <p>
            Either, you can move the objects to let the sensors detect them or
            move the sensor to detect which object.
          </p>
          <p>
            Additionally, you are not impaired from making anything an
            instrument by added the symbol that lets it detect

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I personally think that I may have gone a bit overboard with the
          implementation as it took way too much time than it needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Overall, I'm pretty satisfied with the way it came out, though I
          wanted to add some more features, but thats for another day.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I liked this assignment the most as this was the one where I
          had the most creative ideas I think and so it was pretty hard for me
          to pick what idea to continue with. Specifically, I really like my
          play/puppet show idea and thought it had potential however I thought
          that it might have been too much.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, I wish I had some teammates because I think some of my ideas
          need to be tempered and processed by others so that they can help me
          filter the good and bad ideas.
        </p>
        <p>
          I had a lot of fun making this project and I think I showed to myself
          the variety of ideas that I can produce, I just need to learn on
          filtering them appropriately.
