        At the time of ideation, there had been lots of snow in Calgary. As
        such, I had to shovel it which is quite tiring, encumbersome and can be
        uncomfortable depending on the weather. Our solution?

              car. If there is snow, it will heat the car melting the snow. This
              starts this theme of solving issues with snow.

      <h3>We essentially came down to 3 ideas, 1 from each of us.</h3>

      <p>First being my Snoomba idea</p>
      <p>
        The Second being John's idea which involved strings that would make your
        bed for you
      </p>
      <p class="half-width">
        Lastly, Naheen's idea was an arrow which would work with google maps to
        show you the path to your desntiation and it would work like a compass

            The owners are too old to clean this. Attempting to do so could hurt
            them.

            They let out their little friend, the <strong>Snoomba</strong> which

          <p class="half-width">
            It has sensors which are like eyes, that detect whether there is
            snow infront of it and only shovling till the end of the driveway
            (as it has loaded an image of the driveway internally, similar to
            the roomba)

        Overall, this was my favourite group project. I liked the way we worked
        together and I really like the physicality of everything.
      </p>
      <p class="half-width">
        I really liked working with John and Naheen and I had a really fun time
        working on this project with them.
      </p>
      <p class="half-width">
        I was afraid that I was being a bit imposing (because we were talking
        about which of our 3 ideas to go with) however, we decided to go with
        mine (which I personally felt like was the best one) and I hope they are
        satisfied with the outcome.
      </p>
      <p class="half-width">
        Personally, I feel like it came out pretty well and we were able to
        incorperate other things to the demonstration (like our mock driveway
        with fake snow) which elevated the demonstration
