          nuggets of his life and interests. Inspect the snapshots you take and
          try as many times as you want. You won't be able to catch everything

          The following are some of my initial sketches (10 in total). They are
          a variety of different types of websites that attempt to highlight
          different aspects of Michael. In a sense, they are also a reflection,
          of my own journey on learning about Michael, his interests, his
          likes/dislikes and his overall lifestyle. In my initial meeting, I
          attempted to jot down the things that were important to Michael by
          asking about where he spends most of his time. In addition, I asked
          about fond memories he had and things he liked to do as a child. They
          vary from games to simple "discover something about Michael".

              <p>
                This introduces the use of a crosshair because I learned that
                Micheal likes photography. This is an important feature as this
                is something that we used in our final design. The user would be
                able to use the crosshair to move around and select different
                areas like music or books and learn about his favourites. This
                is also important as this idea is present in 1 of Michael's
                final drawings.

                The top sketch highlights his room (which is dirty because
                Michael said he often procrastinates) and upon cleaning it, we
                learn about his favourite albums. This is idea is reflected in 2
                of his hand-drawn images, one featuring his room, and the other
                featuring his favourite albums.

                The bottom sketch is a game which allowed the user to select

                decided to refine.

            <h3>Refined Sketch 5</h3>
            <p>
              The user would take pictures which would take you to special games
              that were things that Michael liked to do like rock climbing or
              walking in nature and store them in video experience galleries.
              This seemed a bit much storing the videos.

            <h3>Refined Sketch 7</h3>
            <p>
              This was an idea which would allow the user to select some of
              Michael's favourite albums, and depending on how they made Michael
              feel, they would go to a snapshot taking mode where you could
              create a gallery of the background while the album played in the
              background.

            <h3>Refined Sketch 8</h3>
            <p>
              This played of the idea of a gallery but rather than be albums, or
              nature, it was a table with his favourite food. This became one of
              the drawings that Michael eventually made.

            <h3>Refined Sketch 9</h3>
            <p>
              This was an idea which allowed the user to take snapshots of his
              room which had different posters of what he liked like retro games
              (Mario, Final Fantasy, etc.)

            <h3>Refined Sketch 10</h3>
            <p>
              This was the similar idea of a gallery but with a timer, I got
              this as inspiration from another team mate (Erich I believe).

          I was very pleased with the outcome of this assignment. I learnt a lot
          about the design process and I personally found the amount of
          sketching really valuable though quite difficult. I thought our idea
          reflected the personality of Michael in both obvious and subtle ways
          which was something that I was aiming for from the beginning. It
          really helps that Michael can draw!

          I personally came up with some ideas regarding the photography and the
          gallery. I'm not necessarily sure who actually came up with the idea
          as we kind of talked and shared our ideas before all 10 sketches were
          finished and we influenced each other but I really like that we did
          that as it allowed me to gain different ideas and learn even more
          things about Michael. I also helped with development of the app.

          Our process in deciding what we chose was just going through the
          ideas, picking apart what was similar and different as well as taking
          into consideration the difficulty of implementation. Overall, I am
          happy with the direction we went!
